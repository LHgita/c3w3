Course 3: Getting and Cleaning Data

## Week 3, Course Project

### Description and external documentation of run_analysis.R

run_analysis.R contains approximately as many lines of comment, as lines of code.
Therefore, look there for more complete documenation and explanation.

Basically, the program:
* Presumes that certain preconditions are met (i.e. putting the data into the right directory)
* Carries out the objectives of the assignment, in the order that it makes sense to do them.
* Combines data sets.
* Munges things together using cbind, rbind, and melt.
* Labels columns.
* Writes output.

See the internal documentation embedded in the program for more detail.
